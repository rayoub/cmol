6_Batch_Result_v2 Read Me

Updated 3/29/2022 -SS

V2 is updated for Heme results only. This version adds a "cytogenetics" column to column "AW".
Additional columns are added between column "AP" and column "AW" to format correctly for the final
result file.

A "'" is added to cells beginning with "+" to format in excel as text.
Result summary files that do not contain the "Cytogenetics" data field are handled as expected without error.
